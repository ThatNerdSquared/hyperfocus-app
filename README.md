# Hyperfocus: A New Kind of Timer

## What is this?
Hyperfocus is a collaborative timer. Hop onto the site with some friends, set a timer, and get work done together!

- Add some accountability to your work sessions
- Work-life balance
- Get more stuff done!
- Web app built with React and Express.js

## How do I access it?
As of now this is very very incomplete so you're not going to find it running somewhere besides `localhost`. I wouldn't recommend cloning it either as there are likely many bugs or missing features.

### Current Status: In progress but currently unusable
