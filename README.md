# Hyperfocus: A New Kind of Timer

## What is this?
Hyperfocus is a collaborative timer. Hop onto the site with some friends, set a timer, and get work done together!

- Add some accountability to your work sessions
- Work-life balance
- Get more stuff done!
- Web app built with React and Express.js

## How do I access it?
You can visit the app [here](https://hyperfocus-app.herokuapp.com). At the moment it only has one "room" so I wouldn't recommend using it for now.

## Where's the pipeline? What new features/fixes are coming?
You can find the pipeline for the project [here](https://github.com/ThatNerdSquared/hyperfocus-app/projects/1).

### Current Status: Basic features done, usable but not very well featured.
